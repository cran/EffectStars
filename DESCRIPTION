Description: Notice: The package EffectStars2 provides a more up-to-date implementation of effect stars! EffectStars provides functions to visualize regression models with categorical response as proposed by Tutz and Schauberger (2013) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.701379>. The effects of the variables are plotted with star plots in order to allow for an optical impression of the fitted model.
